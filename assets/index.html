                            All modern companies are either cloud-native or in the process of migrating to the cloud. It
                            doesn't
                            matter which cloud provider you use, but it does matter that you have the knowledge and
                            expertise to
                            use it the right way. Your DevOps Mentor will teach you how to create and automate cloud
                            projects.
                            In your individualized, one-on-one sessions with your mentor, you will develop the skills to
                            master
                            the cloud functionalities necessary for modern company needs. We support all major cloud
                            platforms,
                            including AWS, GCP, and Azure. Terraform is our favorite automation tool.

                            team member ensuring smooth and efficient functionality, identifying any issues, and

                            Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK can be used to collect metrics, visualize and analyze them, and

                            Your mentor will be checking your hands-on project to identify mistakes and areas of
                            improvement. The code review process is similar to what you would see in real-life projects,
                            where peers offer a fresh set of eyes to ensure your code is working as intended. From the
                            first
                            day, you will start building projects in a manner that large companies do. This feedback
                            process
                            will give you confidence in the solutions you implement and experience collaborating with
                            others. </p>

                            You’ll meet your mentor and set your goals in your first sync-up call. Then, as you progress
                            through your projects, you can arrange meetings with your mentor to address any particularly
                            challenging problems and empower you to move forward. Over time, you and your mentor may
                            sync-up
                            periodically to revise or update your goals.</p>
